### Getting started

The first thing you need to do is create a window
You can do that by including the **window.h** file then you need to creat a window like so

**Window window(NAME,WIDTH,HEIGHT)

A short explanation about this syntax is
NAME = The name of the window (char)
WIDTH = The width of the window (int)
HEIGHT = the height of the window (int)

#### Exampel:

**Window window("HelloWorld",1280,720);
